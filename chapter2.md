## Numbers

- JS has a single number type. It is represented as **64-bit floating point** (the same as Java's double).

- There is no separate integer type, meaning that 1 and 1.0 are the same value. All you need to know about a number is that it is a number.

- Negative numbers are formed by using the **-** prefix operator.

- **NaN** is the result of an operation that cannot produce a normal result. **NaN** is not equal to any value, including itself. You can detect if a value is **NaN** with the _isNan()_ function.

- **Infinity** represents all values greater than the **MAX_VALUE** property, which has a value of approximately 1.79E+308.

## Strings

- All characters in JS are 16 bits wide.

- The \ (backslash) is the escape character.
